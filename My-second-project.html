      <div class="Intro">
    I've learned how to use <u>simple code</u> to make a website. <br>
    I could for instance quote <a href="www.tweakers.com"> My favorite website</a><br>
    Also I can make a link to a picture and edit the size in html:<br>
    <img src="http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/paomedia/small-n-flat/256/sign-check-icon.png" alt="nope" width="42" height="42"> </img>
    See. That wasn't to hard.

    <h4>Examples of Markup Tags</h4>
    <ul> <!-- this is a tag that makes an unordered list -->
      <li>Bold
    <b> < b > is the tag to define something as bold.</b><br></li>
    <li>Italics
    <em> < em >This is italicized or for emphasis</em></li>
    <li>Break < br > is for line break is considered a void command. It is also an "inline" element.</li>
    <li> Paragraph < p > is for paragraph and helps create an invisible box of text.  This box has height and width and
    is considered a "block" element.</li>
    <li> Images< img > is used to help add images.
    Format: < img src="url" alt="text">. The text within the alt attribute is used to help with broken requests and address blind/accessibility needs.
    images do not have a closing tag (it's called a void tag) no content, no closing tag, like < br >.</li>
  </ul>
        </div>

      <div class="Stylesheets CSS">
      <h4> CSS </h4>
      <p>In CSS you write what is called a selector. This defines what elements of the pag a particular style will apply to. You can select an html tag and that rule will apply to all tags on the page. For example if you want to style all paragraphs on the page you simply write:
        <b>p {}</b>
      <br>Inside the brackets you write the style in the form: Attribute colon vallue. example: <b>p {color : red;}</b>
      <br> You can apply a certain style to specific < divs > by using the class you assigned to it.
      <br>Example: <b>.Markup tags {color:red;}</b>
